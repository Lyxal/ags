<h1>Rejudge</h1>

<p>
For problems with the "rejudge" feature, any user can request a
solution to be rejudged. The record will be removed if the challenged
solution failed. This feature is meant to be a solution for luck-based
solutions.

<p>
To rejudge a solution, click the user name of the record in
question. Fill "golf" to a text box and click the "rejudge" button.
